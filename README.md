# craigsrec_web_app
This is a Flask application that was hosted on AWS (not currently running). We created a web application that used scraped data from Craigslist to recommend possible good-fit housing situations for those looking to rent in the Bay Area. Our solution filtered room listings according to the typical Craigslist filters, but additionally implemented Google Maps API to consider commute time and local amenities. Most importantly, we added a feature that implemented k-means clustering to find like-minded roommates and desirable living environments. This algorithm used TFIDF on the listing descriptions as well as a description entered by the user to find potential matches.

This was the final project for an Application Development class that was part of the MSAN program. This project was completed by myself and another MSAN student.
